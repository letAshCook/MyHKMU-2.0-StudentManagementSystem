- **Teamwork and Programming Etiquette**: Promote best practices in teamwork and coding standards.

> **Note**: A fully working prototype of the product is not mandatory; the emphasis is on learning and practicing software project management.

The group will develop software following appropriate software engineering processes. The project report will encompass some or all of the following stages:

1. **Initiating**
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**
5. **Closing**

Additionally, the report will include:
